## OuchMyBrain â€“ Study Tools

A lightweight set of browser-based study pages (flashcards, quizzes, and a teacher view). All pages are plain HTML and can be opened directly or served with a simple static server.

### Project structure

```
ouchmybrain/
  template/
    index.html       # Landing/entry page
    main.html        # Main dashboard or hub
    flashcards.html  # Flashcards UI
    quiz.html        # Quiz UI
    teacher.html     # Teacher/authoring view
```

Note: In this repo, the HTML files live under `template/`.

### Quick start (Windows / PowerShell)

- Open a file directly: double-click `template/index.html` (or any page) to open it in your browser.
