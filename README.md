## OuchMyBrain – Turn Your PDFs Into Study Power

OuchMyBrain helps students and teachers turn long readings into quick, useful study material. You bring your PDFs; OuchMyBrain turns them into summaries, flashcards, quizzes, and a short script you can present or revise from.

### The problem we’re solving

- Reading is time‑consuming, and it’s hard to know what to focus on.
- Making study materials by hand (summaries, flashcards, quizzes) takes hours.
- Learners need quick checkpoints to test themselves, not just walls of text.

### Our solution

1. You upload up to 5 PDFs at once.
2. We read the text for you.
3. We create four things from it:
   - A clear, concise summary with headings and bullet points
   - Five smart flashcards (question and answer)
   - Five multiple‑choice questions with correct answers
   - A short 2‑minute presentation script

Everything is designed to save time and help you remember more.

### What you can do today

- Open the app and upload your readings.
- Get a clean summary to revise quickly.
- Use the flashcards to drill key ideas.
- Take a short quiz to check understanding.
- Skim the 2‑minute script as a talk track or review notes.

### Who it’s for

- Students who want to study faster and smarter
- Teachers who want quick materials to share or adapt
- Busy professionals who need to digest documents quickly

### Why it’s different

- Focused on usefulness, not just “AI text.”
- Keeps things short, structured, and actionable.
- Works with multiple PDFs at once, so you can combine sources.

### What’s inside this project

- A simple home page with a clean upload bar and language picker
- A large summary panel on the left
- Four helpful tools on the right (Flashcards, Quizzes, Professor Mode, Smart Summaries)
- A clear flow: upload → process → see results

### What’s next

- Add progress indicators during processing
- Make results easy to copy, export, and share
- Expand language support
